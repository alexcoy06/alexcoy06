# Hi there 👋, I'm ALexander Coy

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I currently work as a Teacher Assistant specializing in Frontend Development, driven by a passion for programming. With a strong background in frontend development, I've acquired valuable experience with diverse web technologies to craft engaging and intuitive user interfaces. Additionally, I'm a Data Scientist & Python Developer with 4+ years of experience in machine learning, SQL, and automation. Expertise in data analysis, predictive modeling, and BI across healthcare, retail, and construction. Proven impact: 50% productivity boost, 10% revenue growth. Passionate about data-driven solutions.

I am excited about exploring machine learning and deep learning, especially with my background in construction and machine manufacturing, which I believe will add a fascinating dimension to my DIY hobbies.
